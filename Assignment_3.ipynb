    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "The following functions are good to have in your programs and shows that you gave in depth knowledge and experience:\n",
    "Modularity and Code Organization: Functions allow you to break down a complex problem into smaller, manageable pieces. Each function can focus on a specific task, making your codebase more organized and easier to understand.\n",
    "Reusability: Once you define a function to perform a particular task, you can reuse it multiple times throughout your program or even in different projects.\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions abstract away the implementation details of a particular task. This means that you can use a function without needing to understand how it accomplishes its task internally, as long as you know how to use it correctly.\n",
    "Readability and Maintainability: Functions allow you to encapsulate complex logic within a well-named and well-documented entity. This improves the readability of your code, as readers can understand the purpose of a function by its name and comments, without delving into the details of its implementation.\n",
    "Testing and Debugging: Isolating different functionalities in separate functions makes it easier to test each part of your program individually. You can ensure that each function works correctly before combining them into the complete application.\n",
    "Code Scalability: As your program grows, functions make it easier to scale and extend your codebase. You can add new features or modify existing ones by introducing new functions without disrupting the entire program.\n",
    "Encapsulation and Information Hiding: Functions can encapsulate certain data and logic, allowing you to control access to these components. This principle helps in following good programming practices like data hiding, minimizing global variables, and reducing the chances of unintended interactions between different parts of the program.\n",
    "Standardization and Consistency: By using functions, you can establish coding conventions and patterns that can be consistently applied throughout your codebase. This improves collaboration and helps in maintaining a consistent coding style.\n",
    "Ease of Understanding: Functions allow you to give meaningful names to various operations in your code, making it more human-readable and easier to understand.\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "The code within a function runs when the function is called, not when it's specified or defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "In Python a function can be created using the def statement followed by the function name, a pair of parentheses containing any function parameters, and a colon to indicate the start of the function's code block.\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. \n",
    "Whereas a function call is the act of invoking or executing a function with a specific set of arguments. It's the way you use a function to perform the actions it's designed for.\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "In a Python program, there is only one global scope, and it exists for the entire duration of the program's execution. This global scope is where you define variables and functions that can be accessed from anywhere in the program.\n",
    "On the other hand, the number of local scopes can vary depending on how many functions you define and call within your program. Each time you define a function, a new local scope is created for that function. Local scopes are used to contain variables that are specific to that function and can't be directly accessed from outside the function.\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "When a function call in Python returns, the local variables that were created within the function's local scope cease to exist. This process is part of the memory management in Python and is commonly referred to as \"variable scope\" or \"variable lifetime.\"\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "The concept of a return value is central to functions in programming. A return value is the result or output that a function provides when it's executed. When a function performs a calculation, processes data, or performs some action, it can optionally produce a value that can be used by the code that called the function.\n",
    "In Python, when a function is defined, you can use the return statement to specify the value that the function should provide as its result. This value can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, and even custom objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "If a function in Python does not have an explicit return statement, it still technically returns a value. However, the value it returns is a special value called None. In Python, None represents the absence of a value or a \"null\" value.\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "If you want to access a global variable from within a function, you can use the global keyword to indicate that you are referring to the global variable with the same name, rather than creating a new local variable with that name within the function's scope. This is necessary because by default, when you assign a value to a variable inside a function, Python assumes that you're creating a new local variable.\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "The data type of None is actually called NoneType. It is its own distinct data type, and variables that have no value assigned or functions that don't explicitly return anything are automatically assigned the value None, which belongs to the NoneType.\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "The sentence \"import areallyourpetsnamederic\" does not have a standard or built-in meaning in Python.\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "If you have a bacon() function within a module named spam, after importing the spam module, you can call the bacon() function using the syntax spam.bacon(). This is because you need to use the module name as a prefix to access its contents.\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "To prevent a program from crashing when it encounters an error, you can implement error handling techniques. Errors in a program can arise from various sources, such as unexpected user inputs, external resources being unavailable, or logic errors within the code. Proper error handling allows your program to gracefully handle these situations and continue functioning, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "The try clause allows you to mark a section of code where exceptions might occur, while the except clause defines how to handle those exceptions if they arise. This combination of try and except provides a way to prevent your program from crashing when encountering errors and enables you to implement robust error handling strategies.\n"

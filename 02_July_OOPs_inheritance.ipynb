    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base class or parent class). The new class can reuse and extend the functionality of the existing class, promoting code reuse, modularity, and the creation of more specialized classes.\n",

    "Code Reusability: Inheritance allows for the reuse of code by inheriting common attributes and methods from a base class. This reduces redundancy and promotes modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: The derived class can extend the functionality of the base class by adding new attributes and methods or by modifying existing ones. This supports the principle of open/closed design.\n",

    "Polymorphism: Inheritance is closely related to polymorphism, where objects of the derived class can be used interchangeably with objects of the base class.\n",

    "Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a class can inherit attributes and methods from only one base class. In other words, there is a one-to-one relationship between a derived class and its base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance is simpler to understand and implement.\n",
    "Reduced Complexity: The class hierarchy is less complex with a single parent-child relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one base class. In other words, a derived class can have multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources, promoting code reuse.\n",
    "Enhanced Flexibility: A class can be more versatile by inheriting capabilities from different classes.\n",
    "Expressive Relationships: Multiple inheritance can model complex relationships more accurately.\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Base Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: A derived class can have only one base class.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: A derived class can have more than one base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: Simpler to understand and implement.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: Can be more complex due to interactions between multiple base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: Avoids the complexities associated with the diamond problem (a common issue in multiple inheritance).\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: May encounter the diamond problem, where ambiguity arises if a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: Simplicity and straightforward relationships.\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: Code reusability, flexibility, and expressive relationships.\n",
    "Note: The diamond problem refers to the ambiguity that arises when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. It can lead to confusion about which version of a method or attribute should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing Between Single and Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between single and multiple inheritance depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. Single inheritance is often preferred for simplicity, while multiple inheritance can be beneficial for code reuse and modeling complex relationships. However, careful design and consideration are necessary to avoid potential issues like the diamond problem. In some cases, alternative design patterns, such as composition, may also be considered."

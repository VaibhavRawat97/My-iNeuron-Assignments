This can occur when using input() to get user input from the console, and the user presses Ctrl+D (Unix/Linux) or Ctrl+Z (Windows) to signal the end of input.\n",

    "b. FloatingPointError:\n",

    "c. IndexError:\n",

    "d. MemoryError:\n",

    "\n",
    "e. OverflowError:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason: Raised when an arithmetic operation exceeds the limits of the data type, resulting in a value too large to be represented. For example, trying to calculate an exponentiation that results in a number larger than the maximum representable value for the data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. TabError:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reason: Raised when inconsistent use of tabs and spaces is detected in the indentation of a block of code. Python expects consistent indentation, either all tabs or all spaces, and a mixture of both can lead to a TabError.\n",
    "\n",
    "g. ValueError:\n",
